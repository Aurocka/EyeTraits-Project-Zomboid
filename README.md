# Visual Conditions

This document describes the positive and negative visual conditions that can affect players in the game. These conditions add depth and realism, enhancing the player's experience.

## Negative Visual Conditions

### Photophobia
- **Effect**: When the player exits a building, their vision is temporarily reduced and then gradually restored.

### Night Blindness
- **Effect**: During nighttime, the player's vision is significantly reduced compared to daytime. Navigating in the dark becomes much more challenging.

### Diabetic Retinopathy
- **Effect**: If the player fails to maintain a balanced diet (e.g., consuming too much sugar or not eating properly), their vision will deteriorate.

### Permanent Blindness
- **Effect**: The player becomes permanently blind but gains enhanced hearing ("military hearing").

### Cataracts
- **Effect**: 
  - Over time, the player loses vision range, eventually leading to a state similar to permanent blindness.
  - **Causes**: Cataracts can develop due to:
    - Excessive alcohol or sugar consumption.
    - Heavy smoking.
    - Other harmful behaviors.
  - **Gameplay Indicators**: A "white eye" icon appears in the player's moodlet, warning of worsening cataracts.
  - **Progression**: If untreated, the condition worsens until reaching permanent blindness.
  - **Treatment**: Using eye drops can reverse the condition if applied before it becomes permanent.

## Positive Visual Conditions

### Night Vision
- **Effect**: Allows the player to see clearly in the dark, making nighttime navigation much easier.

### Military Vision
- **Effect**: Enhances the player's perception and vision range, ideal for spotting enemies from a distance.
